reader does this, parent program does this

char buff;
    while (1)
    {
        if (read(channel2[0], &buff, 1) > 0)
        {
            buff--;
            if (buff != EOF)
                putchar(buff);
            else
            {
                kill(child1, 0);
                kill(child2, 0);
                puts("child processes are terminated successfully, terminating main.......exiting successfully......");
                exit(0);
            }
        }
    }
